This is my test online shop project, where I used the following technologies:
- Spring (Boot, MVC, Security, Data JPA, Session)
- SQL (PostgreSQL)
- Hibernate
- Flyway
- Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, Jquery
- JUnit, Mockito
- Maven

This website has got catalog with pages and filters, cart, and authorization, registration, order-creation forms with validation.
After order-creating a proper txt-file is added to the "orders" folder.

Also here is an "admin page", where I can:
- edit a product using website form
- add a new product using website form
- download a csv-file (get a product list)
- upload a csv-file (change products and put new products)
- upload a zip-file with images for products
